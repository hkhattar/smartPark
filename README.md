# smartPark
Designed and Developed a parking app using MEAN stack and deployed on AWS. 
Its a app where spot owner can put his/her vacant parking spot on rent just by entering few required information and other users can see all the available parking spots, rent a space where they want, when they want, for how long the need.
User can check the details of particular parking spot and book it. 
Used Twilio API to send SMS to users having details of owner and renter .
Also, used Google API to validate the address.
